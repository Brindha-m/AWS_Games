## 🚀 Let's Start Our Cloud Journey

* 🌐 For a Static Website, migrate to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
* 🛡️ As an AWS user you can have upto **100** Buckets.
* 📦 Maximum Size of the buckets is **5TB**.
* 🚀 Max size of buckets in S3 is 16GB that can be added through AWS console. But if larger size, use AWS CLI(Command Line Interface).
